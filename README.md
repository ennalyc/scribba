# Scribba
Scribba is a modern language learning tool built around the idea of comprehensible input. It is a personal project I’m building to make language learning feel more natural, intuitive, and fun.

I wanted a space where I could upload texts, videos, and audio, and interact with them easily — looking up words with a pop-up dictionary, transcribing audio automatically, and organizing everything the way I wanted. Scribba grew out of that need: a simple, flexible workspace for learning through real content.

### Features
- Upload and manage texts, audio, and video files easily.
- Automatic transcription of audio and video.
- Pop-up dictionary for instant word lookup.
- Markdown editor for writing and editing texts.

### Semantic organization:
- Selections (editable texts with dictionary support)
- Albums (audio/video with transcription)
- Blogs (thematic organization of pages)
- Boards and Folders for structured content management
- Interactive content blocks: mix and match text, audio, video, images, and links
- Language boards for managing multiple languages separately
- Clickable words inside texts and transcriptions for a more immersive learning experience

Scribba is still a work in progress, but it’s a project close to my heart. If you stumble upon it and find it interesting, welcome!
